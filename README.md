Hello, I'm Zeca, I'm Brazilian, I'm very excited about this fantastic evolution of giving images more life, 
I'm autistic level 1, and currently my hyperfocus is to make music with AI, but the images are static, 
now I see that it will be possible give lives to my AI-generated singers,
they will actually sing the songs! I hope it doesn't take too long to release it to the public! 
If you have to use Github, leave a step-by-step guide. Hugs and congratulations!
